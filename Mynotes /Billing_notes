  - List of resources that are costly are mentioned here 


- To get it in written report 
  1. aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resource --region south-us-1 >> json
  2. In shell, if we what to add more regions we can write a looping statement
      ```
        for i in ap-south-1 us-east-1 ; do aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resource --region $i; done

we can also limit our using Budget and Cost Managment and setting a limit

Best practices :
  1. Always use Infracture as Code - In UI u might forget few but when you use Iac we can delete the resources like in terraform 'Terraform Delete'
  2. Least privellage
